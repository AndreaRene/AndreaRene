                    My journey through web development began with a fascination for coding, and I've been joyfully navigating the realms of full stack technologies ever since. By day, I lead and mentor aspiring tech wizards in a full stack development bootcamp, turning complex coding puzzles into fun, approachable challenges. Every day is a celebration of new discoveries and 'Eureka!' moments, both for my students and myself.

                    When the code rests, my adventurous spirit takes over. You might catch me traversing the galaxies of Star Trek, waving a wand in the world of Harry Potter, or diving deep into the realms of sci-fi and fantasy. I'm also a proud gamer, Disney buff, and a connoisseur of all things anime, manga, and graphic novels.

To weave my passion for coding into impactful projects, to grow and thrive in a dynamic environment, and ultimately, to chart a course towards a bright and fulfilling future.
